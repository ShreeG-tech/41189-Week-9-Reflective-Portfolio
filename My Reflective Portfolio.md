# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio
## Week 9
### What have I learnt this week?
This week we didn’t really do much at all. Me and my team submitted our Pre-submission last week, and are waiting for our results. However, we did go into breakout rooms on Zoom to discuss our progress and assign roles as to who is doing what part in the final group many-model thinking assignment. This week we needed to give another group feedback by looking at the issues they’ve done, and another group would do the same to ours.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week’s learning’s taught me a lot about the importance of teamwork, and how important it is to give constructive feedback to others, so that they can improve. 

### What insights have I gained?
The insights I gained from this week’s content are that whilst I was reading about the peer feedback from other groups for our group pre-submission in week 8. After chatting with my team during our Zoom breakout, we had planned on focusing primarily on the Jupyter coding, as it was the more advanced aspect of the assessment. Moreover, we received feedback from another group-and they bring a fresh pair of eyes to the table, and told us what we could do to further improve on our work. We found that we needed to make the pictures in our assessment more prominent. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Perceived strengths:
-	Knowing how to work successfully as  a team, understanding what needs to be done and how it can done
-	Checking the feedback, and immediately implementing its strategies to polish up our work further

Perceived weaknesses:
-	Confused about how Python in Jupyterlab notebook operates
-	Found it a bit difficult to decipher how to work Github Issues to give feedback, however, it was very interesting to learn that such a thing existed where others can comment on other people’s repositories

### What were the challenges I encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges I observed this week are me and my team were assigned to look at Group 2’s work and provide them with feedback, they did COVID-19, another very relevant issue. They effectively described the issues and the possible solutions everyone can take, to battle the pandemic. It was very hard to find any major issues-however there were a few that we felt that needed to be resolved, and we explained how it could be done. Whilst I was writing my feedback for Group 2, I wondered to myself, what would the other group, whose reviewing our work-think of it? What feedback would we get? 

In life, it is very easy to criticise without offering an alternative solution, as this peer review brought that lesson home. It’s easier to demolish than construct. It’s easier to find the holes in things than to figure out how to fix them up. Those people who take the *'I don’t know what else to do, I just know I don’t like this'* position often do in fact have an alternative plan in mind, though not always consciously. Somewhere in their mind they believe there’s a possible arrangement to be made that doesn’t involve any of the sacrifices, trade-offs and letting go, and compromises that any practical, real-world solution inevitably demands of us all.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is that whenever I am being asked to generate any kind of realistic solution to whatever problem/issue there may be, I need to let go of the childlike fantasy in which I can have all upside and no downside. I found that it requires really digging into an issue, developing a depth of understanding that goes beyond drive-by feedback. This makes for more careful scrutiny and analysis. This also makes for a great sorting mechanism. Whoever isn’t willing to demonstrate this level of investment, to put skin in the game, to show readiness to formulate criticism that is not just destructive, but creative, gives up their seat at the decision-making table. We can all take hope and warning from this, whenever we are asked to provide feedback on someone’s work. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
There were no new theories to learn from this week.
